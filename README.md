  - Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
  - Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

### 1. Installation

spotmux requires the following components:
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) to save the retrieved data in the corresponding collections. 
* A [Spotify Developer Account](https://developer.spotify.com/) with both **CLIENT ID** and **CLIENT SECRET** credentials.
* A [MusixMatch Developer Account](https://developer.musixmatch.com/) with its corresponding **API KEY**.

##### Setting up the project
Set up all the paths and links of the module from your root directory.

```sh
$ pip install -e .
```

##### Install dependencies
Install all the dependencies of the module.

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##### Setting up environment variables
In order to run the module, you would need to create the following environment variables:

### 2. Examples


#### Building for source
For production release:
```sh
$ gulp build --prod
```
Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:
```sh
$ gulp build dist --prod
```
### Docker
Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t joemccann/dillinger:${package.json.version} .
```
This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies. Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart="always" <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```
